# Day 2

## ThunderSTORM

Install ImageJ (FIJI) if needed, and download the latest version of [ThunderSTORM](https://zitmen.github.io/thunderstorm/) (direct link [here](https://github.com/zitmen/thunderstorm/releases/download/v1.3/Thunder_STORM.jar)). For installation, copy the downloaded Thunder_STORM.jar file into ImageJ's plugins subdirectory and run ImageJ. See the [Installation guide](https://github.com/zitmen/thunderstorm/wiki/Installation) for more information. To get started using ThunderSTORM, see the [Tutorials](https://github.com/zitmen/thunderstorm/wiki/Tutorials). 

## Sample image data

Download the sample 2D dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K2HDv05irr0lRki1XyUin-kslO-lKHDH/view?usp=sharing) and the 3D dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SIIWIIejdlseGThZ4kD32-wG8stNmThS/view?usp=sharing). To process the 3D dataset a bead calibration dataset is needed (download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10KMxha2mBfIYwDLmOMasd5qOMM18IkBA/view?usp=sharing)). Due to the size, make sure you download the sample image data beforehand, as the campus network may be overloaded.
